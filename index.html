      <p class='introduce'>From our family to yours, We hope you'll enjoy these tasty treats we make! For a couple
        centuries now, Pat
        has been the owner/operator of our famous bakery. He has passed on the delightful family secrets to every new
        generation of Pats, training them for at least ten years before they are allowed to make cookies for the
        public. New bakers are tested regularly to provide consistent results, and a consistent cookie. </p>
